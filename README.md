For this particular project we needed to work on finding collect the data for the number of users of GitHub.Api based in Chennai who have 50 followers or more and needed to collect information about there repository. I started by first generating a token in GitHub and then filtered out the data using GitHub.Api. I verified the data using python commands. After doing this I worked towards creating the user.csv and repository.csv for which I used python. After creating both the csv files I used Microsoft Excel to analyse and visualise the data I have obtained.

Something that I found fascinating was that most of the individuals have been part of various projects and are licensed from various high ranking institutes. A lot of the are highly skilled individuals in there fields and are extremely hireable.

Developers must focus on collabarating with each others as it will help them develop certain new skills. THey should also be actively be working towards upgrading their skills.
